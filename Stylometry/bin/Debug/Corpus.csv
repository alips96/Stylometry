How to Build an H-Bomb Making and owning an H-bomb is the kind of challenge real Americans seek. Who wants to be a passive victim of nuclear war when, with a little effort, you can be an active participant? Bomb shelters are for losers. Who wants to huddle together underground eating canned Spam? Winners want to push the button themselves. Making your own H-bomb is a big step in nuclear assertiveness training -- it's called Taking Charge. We're sure you'll enjoy the risks and the heady thrill of playing nuclear chicken. Introduction When the Feds clamped down on The Progressive magazine for attempting to publish an article on the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb, it piqued our curiosity. Was it really true that atomic and hydrogen bomb technology was so simple you could build an H-bomb in your own kitchen? Seven Days decided to find out. Food editor Barbara Ehrenreich, investigative reporter Peter Biskind, Photographer Jane Melnick and nuclear scientist Michio Kaku were given three days to cook up a workable H-bomb. They did and we have decided to share their culinary secrets with you. Not that Seven Days supports nuclear terrorism. We don't. We would prefer to die slowly from familiar poisons like low-level radiation, microwaves, DDT, DBCP, aflatoxins, PBBs, PBCs, or food dyes, rather than unexpectedly, say as hostage to a Latvian nationalist brandishing a homemade bomb. In our view the real terrorists are the governments, American, Soviet, French, Chinese, and British, that are hoarding H-bombs for their own use, and worse still, those governments (U.S., French and German) that are eagerly peddling advanced nuclear technology to countries like South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina so that they can make their own bombs. When these bombs are used, and they will be, it will be the world's big-time nuclear peddlers, along with corporate suppliers like General Electric, Westinghouse, and Gulf Oil, that we can thank for it. Gagging The Progressive will do no more for national security than backyard bomb shelters because like it or not the news is out. The heart of the successful H-bomb is the successful A-bomb. Once you've got your A-bombs made the rest is frosting on the cake. All you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate they'll start off a hydrogen-fusion reaction.  Part 1: Making Your Bomb Step 1: Getting the Ingredients Uranium is the basic ingredient of the A-bomb. When a uranium atom's nucleus splits apart, it releases a tremendous amount of energy (for its size), and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei, releasing more energy, in what is called a 'chain reaction'. (When atoms split, matter is converted into energy according to Einstein's equation E=MC2. What better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks?) There are two kinds (isotopes) of uranium: the rare U-235, used in bombs, and the more common, heavier, but useless U-238. Natural uranium contains less than 1 percent U-235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be 'enriched' to 90 percent U-235 and only 10 percent U-238. Plutonium-239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for U-235. Ten pounds of U-235 (or slightly less plutonium) is all that is necessary for a bomb. Less than ten pounds won't give you a critical mass. So purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle. It is infinitely easy to steal ready-to-use enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself. And stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds. There are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium... Enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. From there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal. Each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of U-235, and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment. Conversion facilities exist at Hematite, Missouri; Apollo, Pennsylvania; and Erwin, Tennessee. The Kerr-McGee plant at Crescent Oklahoma -- where Karen Silkwood worked -- was a conversion plant that 'lost' 40 lbs of plutonium. Enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuel-fabricating plants like those in New Haven, San Diego; or Lynchburg, Virginia. (A former Kerr-McGee supervisor, James V. Smith, when asked at the Silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft, testified that 'There were none of any kind, no guards, no fences, no nothing.') Plutonium can be obtained from places like United Nuclear in Pawling, New York; Nuclear Fuel Services in Erwin, Tennessee; General Electric in Pleasanton, California; Westinghouse in Cheswick, Pennsylvania; Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) in Leechburg, Pennsylvania; and plants in Hanfford, Washington and Morris, Illinois. According to Rolling Stone magazine the Israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from NUMEC. Finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while it's en-route from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants. It is usually transported (by air or truck) in the form of uranium oxide, a brownish powder resembling instant coffee, or as a metal, coming in small chunks called 'broken buttons.' Both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5-inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums. The drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked 'Fissible Material' or 'Danger, Plutonium.' A typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio to the conversion plant in Hematite Missouri then to Kansas City by truck where it would be flown to Los Angeles and then trucked down to the General Atomic plant in San Diego. The plans for the General Atomic plant are on file at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's reading room at 1717 H Street NW Washington. A Xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public. If you can't get hold of any enriched uranium you'll have to settle for commercial grade (20 percent U-235). This can be stolen from university reactors of a type called TRIGA Mark II, where security is even more casual than at commercial plants. If stealing uranium seems too tacky you can buy it. Unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for $23 a pound. Commercial grade (3 to 20 percent enriched) is available for $40 a pound from Gulf Atomic. You'll have to enrich it further yourself. Quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass. You'll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercial-grade uranium. (It's only 20 percent U-235 at best, and you need 10 pounds of U-235 so... ) But with a little kitchen-table chemistry you'll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide you've purchased into a liquid form. Once you've done that, you'll be able to separate the U-235 that you'll need from the U-238. First pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide, converting it to uranium tetrafluoride. (Safety note: Concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass, so store it only in plastic. Used 1-gallon plastic milk containers will do.) Now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride, the gaseous form of uranium, which is convenient for separating out the isotope U-235 from U-238. To get the hexafluoride form, bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride. Fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemical-supply firms. Be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine, the classic World War I poison gas. Chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood (the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors). If you've done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching. In the old horse-and-buggy days of A-bomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes, tubes, and membranes, until the U-235 was eventually separated from the U-238. This gaseous-diffusion process, as it was called is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Gaseous-diffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of $2-billion each. So forget it. There are easier, and cheaper, ways to enrich your uranium. First transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure. You can use a bicycle pump for this. Then make a simple home centrifuge. Fill a standard-size bucket one-quarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride. Attach a six-foot rope to the bucket handle. Now swing the rope (and attached bucket) around your head as fast as possible. Keep this up for about 45 minutes. Slow down gradually, and very gently put the bucket on the floor. The U-235, which is lighter, will have risen to the top, where it can be skimmed off like cream. Repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium. (Safety note: Don't put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket. Use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room. This will prevent the premature build-up of a critical mass.) Now it's time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form. This is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium (available in tablet form from your drugstore) into each bucket of uranium. The calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride, a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal. A few precautions: • While uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts you'll be handling, if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron, the kind you can buy in dental supply stores. • Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known. If inhaled, a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs, a painful way to go. Even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer. If eaten plutonium is metabolized like calcium. It goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells. The best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it. If this is too difficult wear a mask. To avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule: never make an A-bomb on an empty stomach. • If you find yourself dozing off while you're working, or if you begin to glow in the dark, it might be wise to take a blood count. Prick your finger with a sterile pin, place a drop of blood on a microscope slide, cover it with a cover slip, and examine under a microscope. (Best results are obtained in the early morning.) When you get leukemia, immature cells are released into the bloodstream, and usually the number of white cells increases (though this increase might take almost 2 weeks). Red blood cells look kind of like donuts (without the hole), and are slightly smaller than the white cells, each of which has a nucleus. Immature red cells look similar to white cells (i.e.. slightly larger and have a nucleus). If you have more than about 1 white cell (including immature ones) to 400 red cells then start to worry. But, depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb, a short life expectancy might not be a problem.  Step 2: Assembling the A-Bomb Now that you've acquired the enriched uranium, all that's left is to assemble your A-bomb. Go find a couple of stainless steel salad bowls. You also want to separate your 10 pounds of U-235 into two hunks. (Keep them apart!) The idea is to push each half your uranium into the inside of a bowl. Take one hunk of your uranium and beat it into the inside of the first bowl. Uranium is malleable, like gold, so you should have no trouble hammering it into the bowl to get a good fit. Take another five-pound hunk of uranium and fit it into a second stainless steel bowl. These two bowls of U-235 are the 'subcritical masses' which, when brought together forcefully, will provide the critical mass that makes your A-bomb go. Keep them a respectful distance apart while working because you don't want them to 'go critical' on you... At least not yet. Now hollow out the body of an old vacuum cleaner and place your two hemispherical bowls inside, open ends facing each other, no less than seven inches apart, using masking tape to set them up in position. The reason for the steel bowls and the vacuum cleaner, in case you're wondering, is that these help reflect the neutrons back into the uranium for a more efficient explosion. 'A loose neutron is a useless neutron' as the A-bomb pioneers used to say. As far as the A-bomb goes, you're almost done. The final problem is to figure out how to get the two U-235 hemispheres to smash into each other with sufficient force to set off a truly effective fission reaction. Almost any type of explosive can be used to drive them together. Gunpowder, for example, is easily made at home from potassium nitrate, sulfur, and carbon. Or, you can get some blasting caps or TNT. (Buy them or steal them from a construction site.) Best of all is C4 plastic explosive. You can mold it around your bowls, and it's fairly safe to work with. (But, it might be wise to shape it around an extra salad bowl in another room, and THEN fit it to your uranium-packed bowls. This is particularly true in winter, when a stray static electrical charge might induce ignition in the C4. A responsible bomb maker considers it impolite to accidentally destroy more of the neighborhood than absolutely necessary.) Once the explosives are in place all you need to do is hook up a simple detonation device with a few batteries, a switch, and some wire. Remember though that it is essential that the two charges -- one on each side of the casing -- go off simultaneously. Now put the whole thing in the casing of an old Hoover vacuum cleaner and you're finished with this part of the process. The rest is easy.  Step 3: Make More A-Bombs Following the Directions Above  A Word to the Wise About Wastes After your A-bomb is completed you'll have a pile of moderately fatal radioactive wastes like U-238. These are not dangerous, but you do have to get rid of them. You can flush leftovers down the toilet. (Don't worry about polluting the ocean, there is already so much radioactive waste there, a few more bucketfuls won't make any waves whatsoever.) If you're the fastidious type -- the kind who never leaves gum under their seat at the movies -- you can seal the nasty stuff in coffee cans and bury it in the backyard, just like Uncle Sam does. If the neighbor kids have a habit of trampling the lawn, tell them to play over by the waste. You'll soon find that they're spending most of their time in bed.  Going First Class If you're like us, you're feeling the economic pinch, and you'll want to make your bomb as inexpensively as possible, consonant of course with reasonable yield. The recipe we've given is for a budget-pleasing H-bomb, no frills, no flourishes; it's just a simple 5-megaton bomb, capable of wiping out the New York metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay area, or Boston. But don't forget, your H-bomb will only be as good as the A-bombs in it. If you want to spend a little more money you can punch-up your A-bomb considerably. Instead of centrifuging your uranium by hand, you can buy a commercial centrifuge. (Fisher Scientific sells one for about $1000.) You also might want to be fussier about your design. The Hiroshima bomb, a relatively crude one, only fissioned 1 percent of it's uranium and yielded only 13 kilotons. In order to fission more of the uranium, the force of your explosive 'trigger' needs to be evenly diffused around the sphere; the same pressure has to be exerted on every point of the sphere simultaneously. (It was a technique for producing this sort of simultaneous detonation by fashioning the explosives into lenses that the government accused Julius and Ethel Rosenberg of trying to steal).  Part 2: Putting Your H-Bomb Together The heart of the H-bomb is the fusion process. Several A-bombs are detonated in such a way as to create the extremely high temperature (100 million degrees C) necessary to fuse lithium deuteride (LiD) into helium. When the lithium nucleus slams into the deuterium nucleus, two helium nuclei are created, and if this happens to enough deuterium nuclei rapidly enough, the result is an enormous amount of energy: the energy of the H-bomb. You don't have to worry about stealing lithium deuteride, it can be purchased from any chemical-supply house. It costs $1000 a pound. If your budget won't allow it you can substitute lithium hydride at $40 a pound. You will need at least 100 pounds. It's a corrosive and toxic powder so be careful. Place the lithium deuteride or hydride in glass jars and surround it with four A-bombs in their casings. Attach them to the same detonator so that they will go off simultaneously. The container for the whole thing is no problem. They can be placed anywhere: Inside an old stereo console, a discarded refrigerator, etc... When the detonator sets off the four A-bombs all eight hemispheres of fissionable material will slam into each other at the same time creating four critical masses and four detonations. This will raise the temperature of the lithium deuteride to 100 million degrees C fast enough (a few billionths of a second) so that the lithium will not be blown all over the neighborhood before the nuclei have time to fuse. The result, at least 1000 times the punch of the puny A-bomb that leveled Hiroshima (20 million tons of TNT vs. 20 thousand tons.)  Part 3: What to do With Your Bomb Now that you have a fully assembled H-bomb housed in an attractive console of your choice you may be wondering, 'What should I do with it?' Every family will have to answer this question according to its own tastes and preferences, but you may want to explore some possibilities which have been successfully pioneered by the American government. 1. Sell Your Bomb and Make a Pile of Money In these days of rising inflation, increasing unemployment, and an uncertain economic outlook, few businesses make as much sense as weapons production. If your career forecast is cloudy, bomb sales may be the only sure way to avoid the humiliation of receiving welfare, or unemployment. Regardless of your present income level, a home H-bomb business can be an invaluable income supplement, and certainly a profitable alternative to selling Tupperware or pirated Girl Scout cookies. Unfortunately for the family bomb business, big government has already cornered a large part of the world market. But this does not mean that there is a shortage of potential customers. The raid on Entebee was the Waterloo of hijacking, and many nationalist groups are now on the alert for new means to get their message across. They'd jump at the chance to get hold of an H-bomb. Emerging nations which can't ante up enough rice or sugar to buy themselves a reactor from G.E. or Westinghouse are also shopping around. You may wonder about the ethics of selling to nations, or groups, whose goals you may disapprove of. But here again, take a tip from our government: forget ideology -- it's cash that counts. And remember, H-bomb sales have a way of escalating, almost like a chain reaction. Suppose you make a sale to South Yemen which you believe to be a Soviet puppet. Well within a few days some discrete inquiries from North Yemen and possibly the Saudis, the Egyptians and the Ethiopians as well can be expected. Similarly, a sale to the IRA will generate a sale to the Ulster government; and a sale to the Tanzanians will bring the Ugandans running, and so forth. It doesn't matter WHICH side you're on, only how many sides there are. Don't forget about the possibility of repeat sales to the same customer. As the experience of both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. has shown, each individual nation has a potentially infinite need for H-bombs. No customer -- no matter how small -- can ever have too many. 2. Use Your Bomb at Home Many families are attracted to the H-bomb simply as a 'deterrent.' A discrete sticker on the door or on the living room window saying 'This Home Protected by H-bomb' will discourage IRS investigators, census takers, and Jehovah's Witnesses. You'll be surprised how fast the crime rate will go down and property values will go up. And once the news gets out that you are a home H-bomb owner you'll find that you have unexpected leverage in neighborhood disputes over everything from parking places and stereo noise levels to school tax rates. So relax and enjoy the pride and excitement of home H-bomb ownership!  Is It For You? Let's be honest. The H-bomb isn't for everyone. Frankly there are people who can't handle it. They break out in hives at the very mention of mega-death, fallout, or radiation sickness. The following quiz will help you find out whether you have what it takes for home H-bomb ownership. If you can answer 'yes' to six or more of these questions, then you're emotionally eligible to join the nuclear club. If not, a more conventional weapon may be more your cup of tea, try botulism-toxin, laser rays, or nerve gas. 1. I ignore the demands of others. 2. I subscribe to one or more of the following: Soldier of Fortune, Hustler, Popular Mechanics, Self. 3. Though I have many interesting acquaintances, I am my own best friend. 4. I know what to say after you say 'Hello,' but I am seldom interested in pursuing the conversation. 5. I have seen the movie 'The Deer Hunter' more than once. 6. I know that everyone can be a winner if they want to, and I resent whiners. 7. I own one or more of the following: handgun, video game, trash compactor, snowmobile. 8. I am convinced that leukemia is psychosomatic. 9. I am aware that most vegetarians are sexually impotent. 10. I have read evidence that solar energy is a Communist conspiracy.  Myths About Nuclear War Ever since the first mushroom cloud over Hiroshima ushered in the atomic age, a small group of nay-sayers and doom-mongers has lobbied, campaigned and demonstrated to convince Americans that H-bomb ownership, along with nuclear power, is dangerous and unhealthy. Using their virtual stranglehold over the media, these people have tried to discredit everything nuclear from energy to war. They have vastly overrated the risks of nuclear bombs and left many Americans feeling demoralized and indecisive; not sure where the truth lies. Well, here are the myths, and here are the facts. Myth: After a nuclear exchange the earth will no longer be suitable for human habitation. Fact: This is completely false. According to one scientist (quoted in John McPee's The Curve of Binding Energy) 'The largest bomb that has ever been exploded anywhere was 60 megatons, and that is one-thousandth the force of an earthquake, one-thousandth the force of a hurricane. We have lived with earthquakes and hurricanes for a long time.' Another scientist adds, 'It is often assumed that a full blown nuclear war would be the end of life on earth. That is far from the truth. To end life on earth would take at least a thousand times the total yield of all the nuclear explosives existing in the world, and probably a lot more.' Even if humans succumbed, many forms of life would survive a nuclear free-for-all, cockroaches, certain forms of bacteria, and lichens, for instance. Myth: Radiation is bad for you. Fact: Everything is bad for you if you have too much of it. If you eat too many bananas you'll get a stomach-ache. If you get too much sun you can get sunburned (or even skin cancer). Same thing with radiation. Too much may make you feel under the weather, but nuclear industry officials insist that there is no evidence that low-level radiation has any really serious adverse effects. And, high-level radiation may bring unexpected benefits. It speeds up evolution by weeding out unwanted genetic types and creating new ones. (Remember the old saying, 'Two heads are better than one.') Nearer to home, it's plain that radiation will get rid of pesky crab grass and weeds, and teenagers will find that brief exposure to a nuclear burst vaporizes acne and other skin blemishes. (Many survivors of the Hiroshima bomb found that they were free from skin and it's attendant problems forever.) We hope this clears up any misconceptions you may have had. Enjoy your H-Bomb!           """

So every other year I am forced to start over. This is like the others, but different. This is more important to me than anything else. I can't start over again. Mabey I'll be invisable, never get into another relationship again. I know it will just shatter like the rest. I can't stand to be hurt one more time. I can't pick up the shards of my broken heart alone anymore. But I have no choice. Some people say 'The future depends on you', but really you depend on the future. So I'm depending on the future... that tomarrow will be a better day. I will be optomistic and spend as much time as I can with my friends, for I only have a short time with them.

Our teacher gives us a topic to write about. We get a generally short time limit to write as much as we can about this topic keeping it as legible as we can. In this “Quick Write” the topic was My Best Friend. We were to describe our best friend, or if you didn’t have one, you could write about what your best friend would be like. That was my circumstance.  My best friend would be a great person, perfect in my eyes. He’d be easy to talk to. He’d always listen and He’d be great at giving advice. I wouldn’t be afraid to tell Him my deepest, darkest secrets; I’d know He would keep them. He would not be judgmental. My best friend would never ask why I am the way I am, or why I do the things I do; He would already know. He would be extremely intelligent. I would never have to explain myself to Him; He’d simply accept everything. He would never be bitter at me for my wrong doings, but would always praise me for the things I do right. He’d be the only one with an unconditional love for me. He would never play favorites; He’d treat everyone as equals. Above all, my best friend would be a Christian, a healthy Christian who was very close to God. He’d be my best friend.  It was not until when I read it aloud to my mother when I noticed I chose my best friend to be male. I couldn’t explain why. Then she pointed out that every time the nameless friend was mentioned, I had capitalized the pronoun.

Shit, no wonder the libertarians never make it into office. To blatantly state    'We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating AFDC, food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.' ...is a ballsy move.  Oh? You thought that was it? Theres more:  'The bulk of your welfare tax dollars goes to pay the handsome salaries of well-educated welfare workers. The poor get little from government welfare except meager handouts and a cycle of despair.' Again...ummmm, what? So, let me get this right....government should stop paying the 'meager handouts' to families in need, and instead have those families go begging churches and charities for even smaller handouts..because...those 'meager' handouts are causing the moneywell to go dry? But hey, it's ok to throw cash at foreign countries and help THEIR people out. Who cares that most of them deteste the United States, and somewhere in their hearts pray for our annihilation. I bet those little bastards setting our flag on fire and stomping all over it after 9/11, aren't aware that our money covered their birth. Nothing better than paying for the future of terrorism.  Maybe i'm taking this personally, as I should. Because without the ever so popular 'welfare system'. My mother and myself might have suffered. Blah. I can see you all thinking that your precious greens have in some way helped me become the fine young woman I am today. BZZZZZZZT. Think again. The sum of monies my mother received could be accounted for with taxes paid out from my immediate family alone. She could have been on welfare for another 20 years, and technically, taxes paid by my extended families would have covered it. So i'll just thank them, and give you the middle finger for being arrogant enough to think that you have had any impact on my families financial prosperity. And now the shoe is on the other foot, or however it goes, and my taxes are paying for your sisters-mothers-best-friends-brother-nieces illegitimate kids.

Here is another Liberal issue, surely the cure to the nations healtcare AND war on drugs. Let's just legalise it!!! It's typical of the liberal party to promote the legalisation of drugs isn't it. I mean, for their stance on issues alone, they have to be smoking or snorting something. The liberals take on anything seems to be 'We can't control it so lets just legalise it and save ourselves the time and money it would take to correct it.' If you see it that way, you're a plain idiot. Does rehabiliation not cost money? Do damages not cost money? Ok, give some kid easy access to some pot, so they can fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a building. Or kill someone. 'Drugs should be legal. Individuals have the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies, so long as they take responsibility for their actions.' Ok, well when these users are irresponsible and their actions endanger other people, .. THEN WHAT? Let me guess, have their parents bear the responsibility. Riiight.  'Addicts out of control were a tiny minority.' Um...So was obesity. See how thats change. And food IS legal!  I can almost picture it...1972, after a demonstration on public sex, and the art of smoking pot through your girlfriends vagina, a group of teenage dropouts were arrested and spent a night in jail where they concocted this notion that if everything were legalised, the standard of their living would be improved and fuck consequences of drug induced peoples, fuck work performance, fuck cost of consequences, fuck everyone else.

And the fact that my folks continually put up with her sh** astounds me. KICK HER OUT OF THE GOD DAMN HOUSE!! I'm sorry, she no longer has gas money to get to/from work until her next payday because she's giving it to her deadbeat, no job, I-scam-my-own-kid-because-I'm-too-lazy-to-work boyfriend. Make her walk to work Dad, take the bus, whatever. MAKE HER GROW UP!! Stop bailing her out, literally, figuratively, you name it. Just stop. Stop cosigning her bankruptcy papers, stop interrupting your day to bring her lunch, stop letting her order beer with dinner after two DUI's, stop allowing her jackass boyfriend over without backing your threats to call the cops on him.

You may be familiar with it, what with its trendy, overpriced department stores and coffee shops, orange-fleshed patrons pushing the pedals of their graduation-gift Lexuses with their pristine Ugg boots. Hell. We honestly could not understand what about this place made seemingly normal people such twits. Parents suddenly flinging their toddlers into the street because they, after all,  do  have the right of way. Stay at home moms in trendy Touregs blocking entire lanes in the parking lot so that they could selfishly have that next available spot, no matter how long the line behind her was. HELL!

The chaos, the carelessness, the selfish people who think it's all about them in this world. It's making me already dread the approaching holiday season, for the love of God!

They're one of the only true bonuses of gaining a few extra pounds, and I love it. They're squishy, they bounce just so, they help fill out an outfit just a bit more, they draw (sometimes flattering, other times creepy) stares, they're fun.

You see, a mother gives her children life- but Becky has returned the favor.      ( flashback) 12/27/2002- 9:30 pm. I had just goten home from work. Tired, but no more so than any normal day. Becky was up and asked if she could have ice cream. I remember saying that if she could get it herself, she could have it. The next thing I saw was some strange lady washing my hair. I was in the hospital, apparently having just had brain surgery. An Aneurysm that would have ended my life except for 1 thing. BECKY. She was there, and I have since learned, called 911, her dad, and gave me her breath to keep me alive. I would not be here if not for her. I love my daughter.

Shall start over again.  Haiz..today is the 'Meet Parents' Day'. And of course, i'm included. (as usual though coz almost everybody else have to go) Miraculously, my father decided to sent me n my mother to school...(it is unusual of him to do that, since he always prefers staying at home and sleep all his want since it is a day off for him as it's the holidays for the students, and he need not teach) Well, it's been raining ever since I woke up. And it only stops until now. The weather is kind of cool...pretty good for time to take a nap...Felt like cuddling up my pillow n goes to sleep..Haha. But alas! I've to go to school in such a weather. And redeem my results slip.  Cool as it is, bright as it seems...but there'isnt alot of students around that time...Guess every other students chooses a time as early as 10 to collect theirs...and only a couple of unlucky teens (like me) choose such a time where everyone is back at home, watching tvs and enjoying themselves...11.45 am is the time.   The first thing i saw when I entered the school...was DT! With 3 other pupils...Yep, all 3 of them are from my class...Dont know what's up with them...and DT...As far as I know, they must have commited something wrong that DT wanted to see all 3 of them. And from their faces, they aren't looking kinda good. Trying not to be nosey, I dragged my mom to my class...where Mr Wong (my form teacher) is.   Well, guess we were the last ones to be seen...There's someone in there...someone familiar...Ok, it's my sort of father's sister's son. (Well, I dont know how to call it, a long-distance relative, maybe?) Anyway, he was there...together with his...erm mother. At first glance, I thought it was my aunt. but then again when they came out, it was not. It took about 15 minutes for them before they come out from that room. And when they came out, his mother greeted my mom. And then when we entered, the first thing mr Wong said wad 'Your related one ar?' And I nodded...  And here it goes....my result slip. It doesn't looks pretty nice...I failed 2 subjects. Haiz...Oh well, guess I've to buck up for my final year..just like what I did last year! I aimed to get back my position for Top 10! Muahahahaha... I've noticed....I always get a pretty lousy results for Mid Year Examinations....and only when Final Year, then my results are of the better. This year, I'm not going to let my parents down either! Afterall, it's an important year! =D  Mr Wong goes on and on about how I can improve on it...and I'm determined to prove that I can do well...and I am made of something! Lolx.. He even suggested me to buy the Ten Year Series books to practise on. And oh yeah, he even asked for my home number...I sure hoped he won't call when I'm least expected. After all, I'm a good student!   Yawn...it's 3pm now..Guess I've got to stop. Today's kind of ok. I'm so bored with nothing to do now...Maybe I should go back on reading the comics...And I just can't wait for tomorrow!

I went out at noon...then when we reach there, it was around 1pm.. And when we got there..i am utterly shocked! There's already a LONG queue there...God, why am I always so 'sway'? But then, I was prepared for the worst...I knew even if i queue up together with the others, i definitely doesn't stand a chance....so, forget it. =[  And just to make myself feel better..I decided to catch a movie! Yep! And I wanted to watch the Day After Tomorrow..but Jiali wanted Shrek2...then we decided to see which movie comes first and decided on which one to watch. And in the end, Shrek 2 shows at 1.30pm and DAT is at 2pm...and I was like, 'Oh man...' Then I started to begged her on watch DAT instead. Then after some convincing, hehehe, I finally talked her into watch Day After Tomorrow instead! (Woohoo~) JiaLi rulez!! (LOlx)  Anyway, as I was saying...we bought the tickets and we have about an hour's time before the movie starts so we went to isetan (which is just below the cinema) and shop around. Haha, we've been to many departments...and like I said, there's a doll which looks REALLy like Jiali! Muahahaha..(oops hope she isn't reading this)and I told her that and she totally disagress with me..  Anyway, we went to the stationary department and I finally found the BLACK shaker!! Hehehehehe!! Well, I know I am wasting money but this is the only way to make me feel better after the loss of the 2 tickets for the Jolin's concert. And time flies, it is almost 2pm when the shows going to start. So we decided to go and make the preparations (like buying popcorns...lolx) And then we finally entered the cinema.  Wow! The show's REALLy awesome! It's the best movie I ever watched!! And Jiali even wanted for the toilet...but i told her not to go. Coz if she were to leave her seat, at any point of time, it's gonna be another great scene that she missed! And finally she tolerate through the whole movie. And it's absolutely a nice movie! So stimulating and romantic(for some parts). Especially how the girl hugs Sam when he was freezing cold after coming up from basement. And the most thrilling part is when the HUGE WAVES of seawater came rushing down to the city! And everyone is running for help...except for the girl who tries to help the old lady getting back her passport...Then Sam came to her resuce...and they are safe and sound! It's really a cool movie!! Like whaT DT have said...Haha  After coming out of the theatre, the first thing we did was rush to the toilet! And God! we didnt even manage to finish the popcorn! We left about 1/2 of the popcorns..coz both of us were to full to continue eating. And after sometimes, I keep talking to her that how great the movie is! And I am SO proud of myself that I told her to watch DAT instead of Shrek! Hehe, no la. Just kidding...lolx  Anyway, later we went over to heeren and planning to go over there and do some shopping..But then as I passed by popular, i decided to stop by and buy a couple of assesment books for myself. Coz my grades really have gone down! And I must do something about it this June Holidays!! Haiz...that means it's still looks like schooling for me...  After that, we went over to heeren...and on the way, jiali stomach pain...Told her to go toilet first liao, she dun listen..Like I always said 'Whenever you need a toilet you cant find one, whenever you dont need one, it keeps appearing' And I was absolutely right about this! She refused to go at first, and when we walked half way and about to heeren, she suddenly stomach pain! Then she say she can't stand it and have to go for the toilets. And luckily we reached there and she took quite a while before she comes out. And I was starting to get bored too, lolx!   Finally, we went to HMV...I was looking for the Marykate and Ashley's VCD..hoping that the price will go down. But instead, the VCD is gone! Haiz...sway lor..I guess. Then forget it, we headed for the bus and went back to BukitMerah Interchange to buy me and my mom's dinner. And then we went back home.  Oh yeah! I forgot that I need to buy the Lime Magazine where this month features quite a lot of my favourite people in it! Great! Really sway ar, today!!! Forget it!  Haiz...

There's leftovers for the tickets in the hello! shop. I got the news from an email sent by my online friends. They said that they came even at 4 something(which was the time when I went there again the second time)and they could redemm the tickets without fear! Argh!!  I thought with such a queue, surely the tickets have been out like hotcakes! But no! And worst of all, they can choose whatever they want! Not according to the amount of people! And most of the people chooses other merchandise like the DVD and posters and the passes. That's why there's so many leftover tickets! But then again, when I read on with the email, I realize something! No wonder the people don't want the tickets! If they had the tickets, they have to apply for a new line! And that means they have to spend more money for a pair of tickets,and it is not worth it at all! That's why almost everyone want something else!  Geez, now that I know the truth about it,I wasn't that upset over it. Coz even if I got the tickets, I couldnt have gone to the concert without applying for another line. Moreover, I've already got the DVD..I dont see why I need another one. And for the passes, erm I dont kinda have the time to queue up with those fans to get just the autograph of Jolin! So, I think I will pass up that too! Lastly, for the LIMITED edition Poster...it's kind of waste though..But still then again, even if i got the poster, i would just throw it one side like the poster doesn't exist.

That's why my friend could tolerate no more and quarrel with her! (Good job! Hehe!)  And she even dare to complained all that to E and A (shortforms..) Then they told my friend about it. That's how she learnt that. And for 2 solid days, whenever May wanted to talk to my friend, she ignored her. (Wee!! Way to go!!)I bet May definitely doesn't have a good time in japan! Hahahaha!!

And then she didnt turn up today for our test, but the test still is carried out somehow, with another teacher of course. And fair enough, we got the same topic and (hehe I've memorise everything, though I've changed some of the words 'coz I can't seem to remember all...OoPs) I started it quickly...'coz we dont have much time after we came back from the Com Lab...and it left us about 20 minutes to complete it instead of 35!  But half way through, the teacher told us we can use the dictionary! My mouth dropped open! I thought 'Didnt she told us we cannot use it? How come now can use??' Oh&nbsp; well, after all I've memorise most of them, there's no further need for me to get a dictionary now...since there isnt much to be look up in the dictionary. So I quickly finish the letter writing, and was the second to finish, but wasn't the second to hand it in...'Coz I dont want to hand up a piece of work with mistakes! So I counter check it.  Then, the teacher broke out the news that we are having another letter writing test on the upcoming Tuesday...and this time it is the formal type. And we are asked to learn the format ourselves. But as she is kind, she decided to go through with us on behalf of our teacher. And we were asked to stay back after school for 10 minutes to go through it...that wasn't so bad. But the worst has yet to come!  She decided to run to ask the HOD of Chinese Department whether she can ownself conduct the extra lessons with us and then when she ask whether she can trust us on not copying when she leaves...and she choose to trust us! I couldnt believe that! And when she left, everyone started to take out their papers and copy...until she came back. And everyone manages to finish it somehow...not all though. -_-'  Chemistry is the next lesson....I hate it! 'Coz that teacher totally sucks! He teaches so quickly and when students ask questions about it, he will yell at them! How weird! And he always like to pass sarcastic remarks on those he dislike! Thanks god, he dont dislike me...He actually treat my classmate a ghost! And he likes to give nicks to anyone he hates! And sway...when he tested us on the Equations, I got picked! 'Coz I was 16!

Inorder to get everyone safely back home, I quickly ask the Chemistry Experts! True enough, I got the answers...but whether or not it's right he didnt say. But for the other team, he didnt got it right, and somehow have to stay back for detention. I thought he was going to say 'Who was the other one that was up there, that couldnt answer the question just now?'(me) But I was standing there, praying hard he won't. And whew! He didnt!

"1240631,male,41,Communications-Media,Libra,""24,June,2004"",""       For shear genius,  urlLink Foucault's Pendulum  swings ellispse's around  The Da Vinci Code . The protagonists of Foucault's Pendulum try to prove a point that the afficiandos of the Knights Templar would believe anything...so they make up their own phenomenal history of man--complete with prophesies and death rituals. They soon find themselves pulled into the maddening world of cultists and true believers...and, of course, satanic death rituals.  For genius and plot  Foucault's Pendulum  stands heads above the Code, yet it suffers one fault: The book is long and tedious. I suspect if I really got into masonic writings and long conspiracy theories, I would find it all long and tedious as well. Three quarters of the way through the book, I was fed up with all the cultist idiocies, and just wanted the book to end. There's a large number of people who would believe anything you stuff under their chin...now get to the end....please.  It is interesting the way that people really want to believe in big plots and grand theological conspiracies. Even more interesting is the way that many people really want to play a part in the great fictional dramas. They kidnap young girls, they fly planes into buildings because they feel they have to somehow be a praxis in the grand social movements of time. They read pieces of fiction with their eyes curled up as they ride Trax to the towering granite ediface in the center of town believing that it will give them some secret hidden powers over their enemies. (For those who are wondering. If you ride inbound Trax you will often see people reading a strange book with their eyes curled up as they try to conjure the hidden powers between the words of the book. I was watching one of these creature one day. The creature was literally shaking as he read. He suddenly developed the most sinister grin on his face that I had ever witnessed. The creature closed his eyes and lipped the words he found...ingraining them in his memory. I was obviously witnessing the birth of a great political strike against this creature's enemies. The creature got off at the towering granite ediface stop.  There are times when I really question why I live in the place where I live. I like the mountains and deserts, but I really have a hard time working for people ruled by revelation.  Back to fiction. In many ways, I agree with Orson Scott Card that Science Fiction really is one of the best formats for exploring theological concepts. When accepted as fiction, the format really lets our minds explore different ideas. We can connect absurdities like Umberto Eco. The open acknowledgement of a scifi book as fiction lets us see different ideas without the precept of having to take them for anything more than entertainment. The method works best for people who see all of the wonderously different ideas that can exists.  Fiction can open our eyes to the way the world works because fiction allows the author the ability to really focus in on ideas that nonfiction lacks.  Yet there is also a strange point where cultism, theology, guruism and pure fiction collide. This is what I find troubling. We create a fiction, then people build on that fiction. They destroy that which does not fit in their world, etc..  I guess I should mention, when I was reading Foucault's Pendulum, I had a rather dull witted boss. He could not understand the ending of the book. Caught up in the strange cult history portrayed by the book, he could not understand why Umberto Eco ended the book THAT WAY!!!!  Could there have been any other way? The ending seemed obvious from the first page. There was just the game of connecting dots and seeing just how the predictible ending would come about.  In this regard, the plot of the Da Vinci thriller was better designed. We did not know the true identity of the grand villian until the last chapter. More of a thriller, the ending was quite interesting in that after the villian was unveiled, all of the strange creatures in the book turned out to be normal people...while the ending of Foulcault's Pendulum comes off as a let down. Even worse, some of the 'normal people' suddenly seem like monsters.         """
"1240631,male,41,Communications-Media,Libra,""23,June,2004"",""       I finally read the  urlLink Da Vinci Code . It was a fun fast paced read. It was much better than  Digital Fortress .   In the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown put together a nice coherent plot, likeable characters and enough controversy to get people talking. Apparently, people are eating the book up. It has been in print for over a year and there is still a waiting list at the library and used copies of the book have not dropped to the dollar level which generally happens as a best sellers move into the yesterday news category.  Overall, I found the book a fun work of fiction that provided some interesting insights into my favorite characters of history.  I do have to admit. In many ways, I am turned off by the message from many pop books and movies that paganism is somehow a superior (more rational and or more balanced) form of spirituality than christianity.   Yet, overall, I think the primary message of the book was on target. The book gives a strong reminder that the victors tend to rewrite history. Trying to actually base our life on any form of ancient writing is rather foolish as ancient writings have been seriously manipulated throughout the years.  The political forces of the dark ages led to a systematic destruction of the science and culture of the ancient Greeks. The destruction was similar to what we saw the Taliban doing in Afghanistan and we see the Islamic clerics doing in Iran. In order to add more legitimacy to one set of books and icons, there is a concerted effort to destroy other competing systems of thought.  As for people destroying history for religious reasons, here in Utah we actually have an extremely large and powerful University that actively works to falsely interpret the history of the Maya, Aztecs and other native Americans to fit what is, most likely, a fictional account of the Americas.  To add an element of conflict to the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown gives the reader the grand daddy of all conflicts...the conflict between man and women. The primary premise of the book is that the Vatican has conspired to destroy the sacred female. The priory of sion is actively engaged in trying to preserve the ancient religious texts that hold a different role for women.  The idea of a central conflict ruling the entire history of mankind is extremely compelling. This is much like what Hegel was doing with his Philosophy of History. He had the world moving through these thesis/antithesis conflicts. Claiming to be a scientist, and claiming his conflicts were scientific, Hegel gave the world a very compelling history.  Having fictional scholars speak authoratively on a controversial subject is a strong literary device. I can see why the book shelves are now full of refutations of the Da Vinci Code as the different fictional accounts of history battle eachother for supremacy.   As for real history. A few days ago I saw the tale end of an interview by Richard Rubenstein for a work called  Aristotle's Children . I placed an order for the book, and am looking forward to its arrival on my doorstep.  If we really want to look at fundamental conflicts at the foundation of society, I think that looking at the ebb and flow of interest in logic is far more telling indicator of the progress of civilization that the conflicts of religion. It seems to me that when there is a due appreciation of logic, the society rises. When the society is dominated by revelation and mumbo jumbo...it declines.         """

The implication is that we are much greater danger because security experts are imagining more.   If anything, there is an reverse relation to what the security experts imagine and our overall safety. The fact that people are much more attentive has increased security.  Now, the fact that we are actively&nbsp;engaged in a war means that security risks are greater. What the experts are, or are not imagining does not dictate the extent to which the US enemies wish to do us harm. The experts' imaginations affect their attentiveness.

"1240631,male,41,Communications-Media,Libra,""06,August,2004"",""       Oil prices hit historic highs. The stock market seems to be in a free fall as a the result.  The one biggest fault that I find with the Bush administration is that it is not using this increase in oil prices to push for long term reduction in our use of oil.  Conservation is not simply about having less...it is about structuring our lives so that we get the absolute most from the resources that we consume. In this regard, I think the steady increase in gas prices is actually healthy for the economy since it is focussing people's attention on efficiency. For that matter, one of the first jobs I had was to use information technology to help reduce the fuel consumption of a fleet of trucks. The rising cost of a resource created a need for people to figure out how to get more from the resources consumed.  I also had temp jobs in construction. The firms I worked for were actively eying the cost of materials. When the cost of wood was high, they would employ people to salvage the wood. When it was low, the wood added to the landfills. Pulling nails from lumber is not the best job, but it is worthwhile in that it shows a tendency to maximize the return from invested resources as the price of the resource rose.  I think it is the nature of humans to become destructive when the price of resources is too low.  Anyway, hopefully the rise in the price of fuel is getting people to think about ways to realign their lives and businesses to be less dependent on oil. Is is possible to shorten the commute? Or perhaps it is possible to own two cars: a economy car for every day travel, then the gas guzzling jeep for rare excursions?  Sadly, our fearless leader is not really taking this opportunity to push long term conservation. Oil prices are rising and Bush's circle of oil buddies are getting richer than ever. Bush looks at the economy. His circle of friends is getting richer than ever before. Nothing wrong here!!!!!!!

I should have realised by the glib, trendy-ness of that guys journal (who i secretly think is now a bit of wanker anyways) that it was an outer, or 'public' journal as my cousin put it....  and who has time to make a cool trendy journal for ppl to look at and say, 'hey, cool journal'!??

"2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,""16,May,2004"",""       *Sigh* Not a good way to start a post i know, but its how I'm feeling right now..  The interview this week (i can't believe it was only this week, feels like forever - its sunday night and it was only 5 days ago) was well, it was a little odd to be honest. The first round was easy, I knew that I was doing well, but this second round, truthfully I don't think I was that impressive.   I arrived at the place a little early and like last time, was surprised to find that there were others there that had been there since the morning.. (another batch of recruits).. why am I always surprised?? I have no idea..   I am so naive like that.. They made us go into this small room, and sit at tables and prepare an individual case study. Mine was about car heaters and the production line, and at first I had no idea what to do. I read it a couple of times to get the info into my head since it was swimming from the excitement.  Then, as soon as it was done, they made us wait before we were taken away to do interviews...   There were three people that interviewed me - Wayne, Barry and a lady whose name I can't remember.  I did my presentation and felt stupid doing it to be honest, since it only went for about 8 mins, we talked about the problem and how to fix it. and then about other things also.   They asked me what my best subject was a uni - wasn't quite prepared, said strategic management. I should have said Business in Europe but i thought strategic mgmt sounded better.  it was still a D  - and worst - chemistry.  andyway, i felt a bit naive, i'm this thing that hasn't been out of uni or had a real job and i'm speaking to these ppl that have worked with the company for almost 20 years, and the lady 7 months. she commuted and said she was getting tired. said alot of ppl did it, which is reassuring.  The rest of my week was a real blur. Wednesday I had lunch with Justin, and it was fine, we have always gotten on well. But then on Thursday I was with Dave and we bumped into Justin and he looked sort of surprised, and he hasn't emailed me since ( I had sent him an email wed night).. he was with a girl, a pretty little girl, and they looked pretty uncomfortable. Which was weird. I am not sure how I feel about it really, I felt a bit down really but thats silly cause he knew new I had a boyfriend (as did I, duh!), it wasn't a secret.... sigh,... i don't know.. all i know is that sometimes there are ppl you've always been drawn to and i just don't want the progression  of our friendship to change now that he's met my boyfriend.. he could have just been really busy and not had time to email.. But i don't know whether or not to contact him or wait till he contacts me.   Thursday night i stayed up til 2 writing my assignment presentation which is tomorrow.   ARGHHH!! My LAST presentation for uni!!! YAY!!  Dave's bday was on Friday and i met him for a drink with his work friends. They are nice, very Australian. Then Dave and I went for dinner at Wagamamas and we got lots of little side dishes.. came home to his place, he fell asleep (cause he had had so many beers), and I went home..   We are getting along a lot better now, we were fighting a lot (or I was) for the last couple of months, somehow he was really annoying me by just being himself.. I am not sure if thats ever happened to anyone else thought assume it has. Although I was feeling a little down this week, I am not sure why. He has been very patient and understanding through it all, even though I was horrible..   I bought him towels and a bathmat for his bathroom. He chose them he's getting quite good at it really. They're really nice, his little apt. is very coordinated and relaxing to be at.. Last night we went out with his parents, they're up from Vic and it was like old times. They sure can drink though.... After we saw them last night I was trying to teach Dave some Canto phrases. He's not bad, but its so weird hearing him say things!! But i like it.   THats all I have to babble on about this week..   Tomorrow starts another cycle.. it never ends.   week 12 at uni only about 3 more till the end.   sigh...    Chaz, if your reading this, hope you're doing well babe.             """

We will require three hours of your time, on the day highlighted below.  In the first two hours you will prepare a case study to present to Masterfoods Line Managers, followed by a half hour presentation of this case study.  Finally we will require you for an interview to commence immediately after the conclusion of your presentation.   Its a bit daunting! But so exciting! I'm ready!!

Tonight is Allys Bday party, i didn't know what to get her (the girls all went in and got her something already, didn't even ask me) so I just got her this hand cream set with little gloves. I think its so cute but i don't know, if she doesn't like it i guess I'll give her the receipt so she can change it... i am over caring what anyone thinks, if they are getting a present from me, they'd better just like it.   I think i'm good at presents, unlike some ppl (one yr the girls went in and got me a picnic basket - i already had one so now i have two cause i didn't want to rude and say anything)......and last yr i asked for cds and a toiletry bag for my upcoming trip and i got this white make up boxy thing which isn't really what i meant (and now lives underneath my bathroom sink in the cupboard as a general stoage thing), so i am going to have to be specific this year indeed...   Sigh.. Dave's bday is coming up and I have no idea what to get him. He is so hard to buy for! Particularly cause I think i am running out of ideas... He needs alot of things for his apt, like towels and a broom but i think getting those might be boring.  Hahah speaking of boring I asked him if he wanted concert tickets to the John Butler Trio and he said he'd like towels... so I guess towels it is then.. and I might take him for a nice meal... he loves king st wharf, as I do, his work always has these social club (yes he's in the social club) dos and the last one he raved on and on about!!!

"4291530,female,23,indUnk,Virgo,""24,August,2004"",""   Hey everyone,  This weekend we were very busy! And we've had a lot of help from our friends. Our neighbors, William and Marie, are very sweet to us and we're always doing something with them throughout the week. William works for a towing company and Marie is a stay at home wife. They live with William's mom, Ida, who is currently having chemo for her breast cancer. She's doing okay, and we've been to see her a few times at the hospital when she stays there. In any case, William and Jeff love to play Diablo 2 together and are constantly talking about the game. William came over on Friday afternoon and told Jeff he needed to move our car. Jeff was a little confused and William said we needed to move our car next to his tow truck so he can fix our flat tire. Yes, our tire was flat! We knew that we had a screw in the tire, but we hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet. Turns out there was a slow leak and so our tire was slowly loosing air. So William popped out the screw, used his tire repair kit and we were all set to go. And William told us normally he'd charge 45 dollars for his services but for us, all he wants is Jeff to deck out his necromancer on Diablo 2. Which Jeff does happily!  Saturday Jeff and I wanted to put up our new chandelier in our stairwell. We've had this chandelier in a box in our living room for about 2 months waiting to get a ladder to hang it up with. Our old one was, well, old. One socket was broken and it was missing all of the glass cups around the light bulbs. The house was built in the 70's and I think that was the original chandelier. Needless to say, we needed a new one. So we got it and it sat in it's box forever. We asked around and my boss at work, Tammy, had a ladder. We just needed to go pick it up to use. Much better than buying one or renting one! So we decided to go down to Tammy's house and pick it up. We took Cinder with us because Tammy had been wanting to meet the puppy. She has a puppy too so we've been swapping stories at work.  We got to her house, and her puppy did not like Cinder, but Cinder was fascinated with Coco. Coco is a Chihuahua and Cinder is bigger than Coco and all Cinder wanted to do was play. But Coco would have none of that. We laughed a lot at them while we were cleaning off the ladder.  And then we tried to get the ladder into our car. We opened all the doors, the windows, put the seats down, everything. No such luck. We thought about tying it to the top of the car but that's a little dangerous. Tammy graciously offered to let us use her van for the day. So we loaded the ladder up, and drove back home.  Jeff got the chandelier up in about 2 hours. It looks fantastic. It's sort of a rustic look, blackened copper and clean lines, no flashiness. It has brightened up the stairwell a ton. In light and in style. It makes the house seem that much more put together. It's amazing what a nice light will do in the house!  After we dropped Tammy's car back off for her (no Cinder this time), we went to Tyson's Corner, a fantastic mall in our area, and bought Jeff new Sunday shoes. His old ones had split off from their soles and you could see his socks through the toes. So new shoes were needed! We found some nice ones at a shoe store in the mall. We also got some things that I needed for Primary on Sunday.  We also went to Target to get another light for our extra bedroom so when people come to stay, they have light in their room! We also got a few bathroom fixtures like a towel rack and a toilet paper roll. A very productive trip. :) We had dinner in a Mexican cafe right near there, and walked around the lake in the shopping area.  When we got home, Jeff put together the lamp and hung the bathroom fixtures while I played with the puppy. All in all, a busy and productive Saturday.  On Sunday, it was my Sunbeams' turn to teach sharing time, which means it was MY turn to teach sharing time. I was really nervous about it. Our theme for the month was 'How can I strengthen myself and my home through faith, repentance, and prayer?' So, I looked at the sharing time helps on  urlLink http://www.lds.org  and came up with one using the shield of faith and darts. See D&C 27: 15, 17. Jeff and I made 'fiery' darts from pipe cleaners and I taped them under a few chairs in primary. For every dart, I had something that could harm the faith in our houses or ourselves like 'You've just come home from church and your friend wants you to go to the movies with him. What should you do?' or 'You're really hungry and your mom is busy doing laundry. You want to eat lunch as soon as you can. What should you do?' That one got a lot of interesting responses. Ranging from 'make something yourself' to 'don't be so hungry!' In any case, Jeff made a shield out of a poster board and we wrote faith on it and had the kids who didn't have darts, come and hold the shield and respond to the problems. It was very cute and they had some really good answers. It went really well and I was pleased about that.  My Sunbeam class is growing in leaps and bounds! I started off with just 2 girls, and I now have 4 little girls (Shelby, 4, Kennan, 4, Katy, 3 and Hannah, 3) and a boy who is visiting for about a month (Zach, 4). They keep me on my toes. Their lesson this week was on I am thankful for my home. I was talking about a picture of a blossoming tree and they all piped up that it was the popcorn-popping tree! So we sang the song, and they proceeded to talk about what type of popcorn they had at their house. It was funny, but WAY off the topic. We got back to talking about who lives in trees and went from there. One thing that I introduced a few weeks ago as part of the lesson is selling Joseph into Egypt as a game. They each took turns being Joseph and everyone who was left were his brothers. I was the pharaoh, and the 'brothers' sold 'Joseph' to me and then came to ask for food. It was a very cute game and we have played it every Sunday for a month. Who knew it would be so popular.  We were able to play Diablo 2 with my dad as we do every Sunday. I think Dad and I died about 10 times. Good thing we're not hardcore players or we'd loose everything every time we died. We really look forward to playing every Sunday with Dad. :)  Sunday night we watched some of the Olympics that we had taped earlier. I've been following the swimming, and of course, the horses. We watched the stadium jumping finals and Germany won. USA came in 4th by like .2 points. I just enjoyed watching all the beautiful horses!  That's all for now! Check back frequently for updates! :) Love ya all, Catherine and Jeff   """
"4291530,female,23,indUnk,Virgo,""20,August,2004"",""   Hello all,  This is the first post on my blog I made to keep everyone in touch with what Jeff and I are doing out here in Maryland. I know we don't keep in touch as much as we'd like to, and I thought that this would be a good thing to let everyone know what's been going on with us. So, just a quick overview and then I'll get up to date.  Jeff and I moved out to the east coast almost exactly a year ago. Although at the time we moved to Virginia to a nice apartment complex called Windsor at Potomac Vista in Woodbridge. It was a cute, 2 bedroom apartment on the second floor with a washer and dryer! My favorite thing in that apartment. We stayed there about 8 months and then moved to Maryland.  Why did we move? Well, in those 8 months that we lived there, Jeff got a job as a systems engineer at Lockheed Martin ( urlLink http://www.lockheedmartin.com ). The job was in Gaithersburg, MD and we thought it wouldn't be too bad of a commute for Jeff so that we could stay where we were. Boy were we wrong! He had a 2 and half hour commute one way, so that was 5 hours a day he spent trying to go places. We thought, 5 hours driving, 40 hour work week, and him going to school full time was too much. So we moved.  We decided to buy a house because the interest rates were fantastic and we would be paying just as much with rent as a mortgage payment. So we took the plunge! We used Weirchrt Relators and found the house we bought the very first day out looking. It was just what we were looking for. 3 bedrooms, 2 and a half baths, with another washer and dryer. Very important, those washer and dryers. :) So on April 1, 2004, we closed on the house and moved in! Jeff now only drives 10 minutes to work every day and is able to go home for lunch every day. Lucky dog.  So that pretty much brings us up to speed on where we are. Now on to what we're doing. We bought a Cairn Terrier puppy soon after moving to our house. We named her Dogwood Cinderella, Cinder for short. She was so sweet as a tiny puppy, and now she's just so much fun. She loves people and can do all sorts of tricks. She can sit, stay, lay down, speak, and shake. The shake is adorable but she sits and lays down the best.  We just celebrated our 3rd anniversary with a trip to West Virginia. It was beautiful. This summer has been nice and restful.  Coming up in our lives is school for Jeff. He'll continue at George Washington University as a grad student. This will be his last full year. I continue to work at Genetics and IVF ( urlLink http://www.givf.com ) in Fairfax, Virigina, making apointments for either infertility and prenatal genetic testing. Boy have I leared a lot!  We've been enjoying our time here in Maryland! More updates to come!  """
"4313749,female,25,indUnk,Taurus,""24,August,2004"",""            Mornin, y'all.      Interesting bits in the news this morning. First off, over 750 fell sick while visiting South Bass Island in Lake Erie this summer. They're not sure what to blame it on... hm... could it be partly because the Great Lakes are some of the most polluted waters in the nation? You stick your hand in the cesspool, you ain't getting it back. It's almost as bad just to breathe in the sea spray. Or- it could be a dirty restaurant worker who failed to wash their hands after a potty break... You see why I don't like to eat at restaurants so much anymore? A pube in the food is enough to turn any stomach.      In other news, the porn industry may require their participants to wear protection. And it only took how many outbreaks of the clap and AIDs to spark this course of action?       Well, another interesting night in the Olympic arena. A white man can  run , and fast. Hats off to Jeremy Wariner for disproving all sports analysts and 99% of spectators who thought a white athlete would never beat a sprinter of any other color.       And- would you believe it- a  raucous  night in gymnastics?       It seems that the crowds have gotten tired of the scores that the judges are giving. After a practically perfect vault from Romania's Marian Dragulescu, the judges almost  begrudgingly  gave him a 9.9- I can't remember the last time I've seen a 10 in this sport.   No one in the world can vault like Dragulescu. No one can stick a landing after a front triple like Dragulescu. A 10 wasn't in the cards, but he's supposed to be happy with a 9.9?    At that point, he was sitting pretty ranked #1. After his score flashed, he hid the disappointment, but fell on his landing on a vault that should have been a walk in the park. You tell me that he wasn't affected by his score.    Move to the parallel bars- same story. A flawless performance by Hiroyuki Tomita was surpassed by a gymnast who was far less powerful and daring. On high bar, Alexei Nemov completed an unheard of six- count 'em, folks,  six-  release moves and stuck his landing. What was his score? 9.7 . It was enough to rile up the crowd and boo the judges. It lasted for ten minutes, postponing Paul Hamm's routine, until Nemov stood up and urged the crowd to stop. Hamm's performance was nearly void of any discrepancy, but in my opinion, not good enough to surpass Nemov, which he did. Unsurprisingly. Hamm won the silver, Nemov's score was enough to send him home in 5th place.    It was a Malaysian judge who didn't think Nemov was good enough for a medal. Didn't you all know? Malaysia is the world's leading producer of first-rate gymansts! Sure are- they keep 'em all in a box underground and they're planning a release in time for the 2012 games.     In other news... I haven't suffered a wedgie yet today.    Peace.                                     """

"4313749,female,25,indUnk,Taurus,""22,August,2004"",""             Hello again, y'all.  I can't resist making a comment or two about Svetlana Khorkina, the russian prima donna of gymnastics.  It seems that Svetlana is pretty sore about losing the all-around competition to America's Carly Patterson last week, and has taken to vocalizing her opinions to a russian newspaper. See, she feels that the judges had predetermined Patterson as the winner, and in her words, 'fleeced' her for the entire competition.  Let me take a step back. Khorkina is a product of the russian sports machine. They've churned out numerous gymnasts, divers, volleyball players, and wrestlers, among others. In a country that is too poor to support its once to be reckoned with space program, they invest everything they can into their athletes, and it has been paying off- until recently.  Alexei Nemov is the last man to my knowledge to win the men's all-round in gymnastics for Russia. Alexander Popov was 'The Russian Rocket' in Barcelona, Atlanta, and Sydney, but resolved to slink out of the pool after failing to qualify for events in which he'd previously been so feared in Athens. Rulon Garder defeated the russian wrestling favorite (can't think of his name, but this man was a BEAR) to win the gold medal. Now, don't get me wrong- these are all awesome athletes. They once dominated thier respective sports, but knew enough when they were defeated. I can't think of anyone who has acted as unprofessoinal and unclassy as Khorkina.  In Sydney, it was discovered that the vault had been set five centimeters too low and consequently sent Khorkina crashing to her knees. My heart went out to her. She fell off the parallel bars. Again, my heart went out to her. In Athens, she fell off the bars again. Guess what? My heart went out to her. When Patterson defeated her in the all-around competition, I felt a sense of sadness as I knew that it would be Khorkina's last Olympics. She paraded around the appartus, toting her flag, draping it over the parallel bars, acting like she has for the past ten years or so- the russian darling slash prima donna- a very fitting role.  She commented that the silver medal was grand, in so many words, and that it was the best day of her life. Yet, four days later, she's changing her tune and crying foul. Give me a break! Khorkina should wait to talk smack after the Olympics are over and stop falling off apparatus- then maybe she'd win the gold medal.  Anyone watching the competition can clearly see that Patterson was the most mechanically correct out of the entire field. She didn't fall, she didn't stumble. She deserved the gold and got it.  Khorkina has to realize that even though she is a sentimental favorite in the sport, it's not going to earn her medals. Near-perfect routines sometimes aren't even enough. It's a different scenario than Paul Hamm and the korean controversy- there, it was the judges screw-up. Here, it is Khorkina's screw up. Get over it, Svetlana. You're not the top dog anymore. The top dog won the gold, and even if she doesn't travel to Beijing to defend her title, she is still the Olympic champion.  However, feel free to come up with your own opinion.      If you're going to award gold medals to sentimental favorites because you feel they should get it, call Popov back to the pool and give him a couple. Give Jenny Thompson three. Hell, I have a lot of friends- give ME one.  Oh, wait- that's not how you're supposed to do it? Somebody had better tell Khorkina.        Peace.           """

Just woke up a half hour ago and I'm ready to crawl back under the covers and snuggle with my pillows.  Anyone else feel the drudgery of life like a vicious, neverending cycle?  Eat, sleep, poop, something like that?        I'm too old at 25 to live on the edge anymore, and on the edge I mean spending all my money at clubs and staying out til dawn, only to stumble into work still smelling like smoke and alcohol.  I did that for a while.  Some of my friends still do that.  Number one, I don't know where they get the money because we all make the same amount, and number two,  it should be old to them by now.    It's like those 35 year olds who still try to pick up girls at the club, all spiffy in thier silk shirts and tapered pants.  Just  old .      I start a new job with FedEx soon, and I'll be working creature of the night hours- seriously.  11 p.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday through Thursday.  Hey, I'm not complaining.

"4313749,female,25,indUnk,Taurus,""22,August,2004"",""            Ah yes, the summer Olympics are now halfway over. I've settled into the familiar routine of watching absolutely nothing but sports for days on end until three in the morning. In about a week, I'll be at a loss as of what to watch for a while and then I'll settle into another routine- the same one that I had  before  the Olympics.      There's always stories that come out of the Olympics that inspire, anger, satiate even. Already I can think of three.      I enjoy Michael Phelps. Not only does he have bragging rights, he  refuses  to use them. He loves to be part of a team. He credits everyone around him for helping him succeed in a sport where it's all touch and go, literally. He's one of the most composed and humble athletes I have ever watched, and it's absolutely refreshing. He swims all year-round to give credit to everyone, himself last.       Paul Hamm is said to have won the gold medal in the men's gymnastics all-around on a judging error, and that the medal should have gone to a korean gymnast. First of all, shut up. Paul fell onto his ass during a vault, sunk all the way down to 12th place, and was able to pull it together enough to medal. The fact that he did  that  should be enough. It's always the fat assholes who like to judge our elite athletes behind a microphone as if it's easy to compete at world class competition level against the best of the best. Who the hell is Al Troutwig? Has he ever competed a day in his life in gymnastics?      And Jenny Thompson. I've followed her swimming career for as long as I can remember. Everyone makes such a huge song and dance about how she's the world's best teammate, helping her team members to the top of the podium, but has never won and individual gold medal. Do they  notice  how fast swimmers are at this level? How close the races are? They speak of a second as if it's an hour. Give me a break. Jenny has balls the size of Manhattan to swim competitively while she's immersed in medical school. She's also suffered heartbreak this year after losing her mother.

Yeah and posting here since diaries.suchisthis, it's server, is being a bitch. Vicky and I headed to Kristen's house in the Bronx for a bbq. She lived far out but it didn't matter b/c we spent the night and it was worth it. Vicky and I ate a lot of chicken and hot dogs. But we  killed  the donuts. It was great but very  fullfilling , lol. Then soon as the hours went by we all went outside. Kristen's neighbors were lighting up fireworks in the middle of the street. It was cool and pretty at first but then it started to swift it's position. It went in the air but then as it went down it looked like it was going to hit us. I screamed my ass off and ran around the corner. There were many coming one after another. I think they did that on purpose just to enjoy our screaming of being terrorized. Kristen was just having a blast laughing at us. She was just standing there like it was no tomorrow. Hmm...let her ass get burned, lol, I'll be down the block. Later that night we had a ritual. A burning ritual. Lol. Vicky and Kristen were burning everything from plastic cups to pop rocks. Haha. It was great. I think Kristen has a slight fetish for hot wax. She kept pouring it on her from the candles outside. I was like what is wrong with you?? Do you know how hot that is? She was like it really doesn't burn. It feels so good. You should try it. -Pours-. *Lets out ahh.* :-/. I really worry about her. Then I was feeling a little darish and told them to flash the air. They only showed thier bras. Pussies I said. They were like well u haven't done anything yet, let me see you do it. So I did. I flashed the air with my feminine parts formely known as breast. =D. Then after burning half of the cups and ruining the poor cement we headed inside for the night. I was the 1st to take a shower. Then as soon as I get out Kris and Vicky both come in the bathroom and go in the shower...together...with thier clothes on. I'm like what in the world. They're like Sharice come in with us. It's gonna be fun so I get in, only I'm already washed and half a little towel on me. It was getting soaked so you know what I said fuck it and took it off. I was completely naked. It was great. Then they started washing thier hair. Vicky washed Kristen's and I washed Vicky's. Ahh those are the hightlights of the night. I had fun. It was the best 4th of July I ever had...yet. I'm out.

Listening to those rhythms may produce visions and lead you towards insight. The Moon is a force that has legends attached to it. It carries with it both romance and insanity.

"3369668,male,44,indUnk,Taurus,""17,May,2004"",""   This is my first entry. I have long wanted to a place write down my thoughts but have never gone through with the process. Today I saw an article on Yahoo that talked about this web site and decided this would suit my needs just fine.  Today is my last Monday working for this company. I am a production planner. The company is closing operations in Mexico and our office, located in San Antonio, is no longer needed. I have worked for this company for twelve years, initially in Laredo Texas, and, for the last 10 years in San Antonio.  Losing my job has me filled with anxiety. I have two children, a nine year old son and a seventeen year old daughter. Although my wife has a good job, I am unsure of what our future will be. My daughter will be a senior in high school next year and will go to college the year after. How we'll pay for that I do not know.  My dad worked as a lithographer and lost his job when I was the same age my daughter is now. We moved to a little town in Illinois where I finished school. My senior year of high school was six weeks long. I had enough accumulated credit from the district I was in to graduate in Illinois and only had to wait through a probationary period to receive a degree. Knowing money was tight, I never asked about going to college but rather started working. My first job was with a company in Merriam Kansas near where I grew up. Finding myself in the same position now as dad was then is really scary. We kids never knew how difficult it was for him.  On one hand I am sure all will turn out well and on the other I am consumed with guilt for failing my family. I worry about how we will survive financially and how we will give to our children the things we want to give them. I look at mom and dad today and see two people that have survived the years still waking each day happy and with a bright outlook. I know, I hope, I will be the same when I am their age.  One of my brothers is currently searching for a job and it worries mom and dad so much I am reluctant to tell them about me. I feel so alone not sharing this but don't want to add the stress to their lives. They will probably be upset when they do learn of this but I'll accept that when it comes.  Luckily, the company is giving me a generous severance package which will keep us afloat until Christmas. I have started searching for jobs here in San Antonio. I will probably have to take a job outside my experience at much less money. Finding work would be easier if I looked outside the city, or better, outside the state. I won't do that as I have promised my daughter I would not move the family before she graduated from high school.    """

Mom had dinner ready when we walked through the door. Spaghetti red, she calls it. It's pasta, hamburger, onion, and tomato sauce seasoned with chili powder. A staple from my childhood.  I came here to tell them about losing my job but find I cannot do it. My brother is still searching for work and I do not want to add to their worries.   Dad's breathing is worse. He and I went to the Walmart today and after walking from the parking lot to the store he had to sit on a bench to catch his breath. He has emphysema. His death looms just over the horizon. All the years of smoking have exacted a terrible toll and he knows it. It tragic to talk with him about the disease.  My son spent most of the day with Mom sorting quarters and filing them in albums. She is trying to get complete sets of the new state quarters for each grandchild. He was thrilled to be helping Gram. She was thrilled too.  We will be here one more day and will return home Friday. I plan to leave early so I can get home and clean the air conditioner that is having trouble keeping up with the Texas heat. The girls are home with all the windows open and the air turned off. Poor things must really be suffering.  It's eleven o'clock at night. I have sorted through e-mail and checked my lottery numbers(dang! Missed again!). I am going to read the news and go to bed.

"1238294,female,33,indUnk,Leo,""29,June,2004"",""             I'm so obsessed with knitting, I decided I needed a spot where I could track my finished projects, muse about future projects, and generally go on about it all without being a drag on my regular journal, where I get to be boring about my life as a mama instead! I thought I'd just post pictures of my projects thus far, starting with my first scarf last November, which I made along with armwamers, with no pattern for a little family friend; however my son, Silas, is modeling them. They were made with some cheapy Lion Brand chenille, since I was deathly afraid of ruining good yarn, and I had yet to discover the many amazing yarn stores Seattle has to offer!        Next I made a couple facecloths for my sisters for Christmas:    I can't recall what order I made all of these, but I made them in December 03 and January 04. The kids' scarves have no pattern, nor does Vivienne's hat, but Silas' hat is 'Hot Head' from  Stitch 'n Bitch , as is my kerchief:          Next came my  urlLink Booga Bag , my first attempt at felting. I used Noro Kureyon #126:    Around the same time, I started a sweater for Silas. I only JUST finished it, so I'll post pictures as chronologically as I can manage. I also started the 'Little Black Top' from  Stitch 'n Bitch  for my sister, and a felted hat for my other sister. The hat is made with Cascade 220 (black) and a Dalegarn wool (purple), held together with a sparkly bit of something I bought off a cone at my LYS.    Next I decided to make a  urlLink little spring top  for Vivienne. I used Paton's Fresco, and loooved working with a ribbon yarn. It was a nice break from the Little Black Top.    Somewhere in there I made a spring shawl out of Plymouth Eros for our co-op preschool's annual auction, but I can't find any pictures. I did finally finish the 'Little Black (olive!) Top', and it fit my sister perfectly. It was my biggest success to that point. I had a huge sense of accomplishment.   Here is Susan showing it off:    I needed a major break from garments after that, but my addiction forced me to goof around with some spare yarns I had. So, yeah, a beer cozy:    That was pretty dorky, but it  did  inspire a little thing I consider to be pure genius:   (don't pretend you don't eat it out of the pint!)  Then  urlLink WEBS  had a huge sale and I got a steal on some closeout Cascade Lana D'Oro.  I started the 'Under the Hoodie', again from  Stitch 'n Bitch . I'm still working on it, currently working on the first sleeve, but here's a view of the back:    After frogging the sleeve once, I got sick of it and put it away for a few days. Well, of course, I couldn't NOT knit, so I seamed up Silas' sweater at long last:       And that, my friends, brings us up to today! Still plugging away at Under the Hoodie, having made numerous stupid mistakes on the sleeve and having had to frog it twice. Next up is Knitty's  urlLink Cleo  for my other sister, Helen.

"3785178,male,17,Student,Virgo,""30,June,2004"",""       I cant believe that im actually making another online journal/diary thing. The last time I had one of these I was in 7th grade. Seems a little immature to go back and make one. But like I told Matt, I enjoy typing a lot more than I like writing. I remember back in Middle School, EVERYONE who was anyone had an online journal. I still don't really get why people write about their secret issues like they would in a private journal/diary online, on a PUBLIC journal thing. Doesn't really make sense to me, but hey...im doing it aren't I? Anyway...I remember I had my online journal till the middle of 9th grade, then after two incidents I decided it wasn't worth it anymore. The first one occurred at the end of my 8th grade year with one of my close friends at the time, Teresa (she moved away, up to West Palm Beach). She obviously had an online journal as well and was actually one of the people that talked me into starting one. Well, to sum up Teresa, she was never the cool cheerleader that everybody liked or even the nerdy art student who everybody knew but pretended not to. She was apart of our little 'click' at school that everyone seemed to stay away from. And of course, people always made fun of us for the way we dressed and the music we listened to. It was so immature, but I guess that's middle school. Its funny cause I look back on it now and I think to myself...God damn was I a fat little idiot. And I see my sister going through the same fazes and changes that I did in/at her grade/age (wow, that's confusing to look at). Anyway, so we were all made fun of a lot and whatever. So Teresa writes about it in her online journal. And I think this was all about one or two years after the Columbine incident. And she's writing in her journal that she's gonna get these kids back before the end of the year and blah blah blah. But of course, all of us know she means just like make fun of them behind their backs because that's Teresa. She doesn't have the balls to walk up to one of them and hit them in the face. Or for that fact, bring a gun to school and shoot everybody up. So somehow somebody in the school reads that entry and decides to turn it in to the School board. And of course my journal has a direct link to hers and vice versa and I wrote stuff like that too in mine, so im not the little innocent angel either here. Well, we are both brought down to the office and blah blah shit happens. They talked to us about the 'seriousness' of this situation and all that other garbage, whatever. In the long haul, Teresa gets expelled and I get suspended, for like a day and then my dad goes down there and raises hell. And well, that's the reason Teresa moves up to West Palm. I feel kind of bad sometimes cause we promised we wouldn't lose touch and I guess we really haven't, but we aren't nearly as close as we once were. I think that might have to do with the fact that she's doing drugs and drinking now, but whatever. Well, that pretty much sums up the first incident. The 2nd one happened with my first girlfriend. The summer right after 8th grade, I meet this incredibly hot girl in my neighborhood through my friend at the time, Johnny, who is actually her brother...go figure. She was such a nice person to me, knowing that I had never had any past experience with girls or anything. This was the girl I lost my virginity to...the sick part was, another girl was involved. That was the one weird thing about Jennifer, is that she was bi-sexual. She had this friend who lived down the street named Megan who was such a little whore and she was only 14. I think I was like just turning 15, so I guess im no better than she was. And Megan would come over and just hit on me non stop...I don't understand why, I was so fat and stupid then...still am, but...a little better. So anyway, we dated for about 3 months and then she broke up with me for some bogus reason, I forget why. I was completely devastated by this too, being my first girlfriend and all AND the girl I lost my virginity to, I was pretty fucked up by it all, so anyway. I knew the real reason behind it. It was because she wanted to date other people cause she was a whore. So yeah, I wrote about it in my online journal. And I called her a whore in it and blah blah and how we had sex in a threesome with another chick blah blah. And im guessing she knew what the address of my online journal was cause she showed her new boyfriend at the time who was this 6ft tall, in shape, knew martial arts, black guy. Yeah, bad news for me written all over that description. Well, I used to ride the bus home back then, cause I didn't have a car and Freddy hadn't moved down yet so I couldn't ride with him. So, one day I get off the bus and he for some reason rode our bus that day. Well, I have my headphones on and im walking home, and this guy decides he wants to fuck with me. He gets in my face and I take my headphones off. This dude doesn't say anything, he just hands me this piece of paper, which I find out later is my diary entry. And when I look down at the paper I look up right after and he fucking hits me in the face. He fucking sucker punches right in the face. Me, never being in a real fight before (only instances with which I've punched a kid out and held one up against a locker with one arm, I had never actually been in a fight with another kid swinging at me) fell to the ground like a ton of bricks. Woke up, walked home with a swollen face and that was that. I never saw the kid in school again though. I wasn't sure if he transferred or whatever...and Jennifer ended up moving so yeah. Those are my two reasons for not having an online journal anymore. Wow...I ended up writing a lot more than I had intended to. Well anyway, till next time...         """

Woke up at 9am...ate breakfast (which Lyn made for me and Amanda...it was goooood) then went swimming and then I went to work. Nothing exciting happened at work so im gonna flash back to yesterday, which actually was fun and im gonna re-title my entry right here. Also im going to speak in the tense as if it were yesterday...or is yesterday...i dunno...   My Fun Day With Matt!!  Today was awesome. I really need to hang out with Matt more often. I love it, cause even if we dont do anything, if we are just sitting around, we always find something to talk about, no matter what. If its music, movies, video games...doesnt matter, always enjoyable. The only somewhat not enjoyable part of the day is when Roxy and Manda decided to come over and have a sit down talk. Which we found funny because I had suggested it earlier, before they came, to do something like that later in the night. So, we all sat down and tried discussing everyones feelings on everything. I  kind   of think it may have helped, but then again...its easy to say something like that wont happen again, but its a lot harder for it to not actually happen. I dunno. Well, after that we all decided to try and patch things up by having a quick lunch together at Taco Bell before parting our seperate ways. After that Matt and I went over to Circuit City to check out some games that Matt was thinking about buying cause he heard that they were selling them for cheap. They ended up not having any that he 'needed' so went over to look at the music section, looked around there for a while where Matt spotted a three disk deal for only $20...he bought it and then we left and went over to Target. He got the stuff he needed and then we picked up Amanda and drove around looking for something to do but ended up just going back to his house. Stayed there till we had to go pick up Jason and then we went back to Matts and played some video games. It was a very enjoyable day. Im hoping Wednesday will be just as fun, cause thats my only other day off this week. Im also really excited about next week though...I get to go up to Port St. Lucie to visit my cousins who i havent seen for like over a year or two. The only downside is that my moms living there now and its gonna be extremely gay. Welp, till next time...  By the way...I LOVE THE MOUSE! ITS AWESOME!         """
"3785178,male,17,Student,Virgo,""04,July,2004"",""       What a shitty 4th of July. I guess it wasnt too bad...except for the awkwardness between certain individuals. Of course i had to ditch work to have this 'fun' day, and for that i got bitched at from my dad AND had a guilt trip given to me from my manager. Then me, Amanda, Roxanne, Matt and Courney drive down to Matt Harpers house to light off fireworks. That was actually a lot of fun, its really funny how afraid of fireworks Amanda really is. After all that, we (me and Roxanne really) decide we should go down to the beach, and Alex decides to come along too. So we get down there and its great, the waters so warm and me and Roxy give each other this look of 'Oh god we wanna go in!' So finally we do. I actually took my shirt off...ewwww...and i somehow talked Roxy into taking her pants off. All she had on was a pink thong...jeez was that hot. I felt bad for looking since Amanda was there, but she has been pissing me off lately. Well, to make a long story short, Matt doesnt come in cause he doesnt like the beach to begin with and then of course Roxy and Amanda call him anti-social and all that, he gets pissed blah blah, everyone ends up pissed at each other. Then we drive back and Amanda decides to go with Alex and Roxy back to his house and leaves me home by myself (cause i had to be home early because of my dad), fucking god she pisses me off sometimes. I dont even know why i listen to her. She only ever thinks of herself. Of course she always does the lovey duvey shit. Oh i love you this, i love you that. But thats all it is. She can never compromise a situation. Its either her way or the highway. And she wonders why i get pissed off sometimes. Ive gotten to the point that i just want to punch her in the face, just square in the fucking face just so she would stop talking or laughing or whatever she was doing at the time. I wish things were the way they used to be when we first started going out. But i guess everybody wishes that from time to time. She doesnt get how things work sometimes though. If i ever make her feel bad for any little fucking thing, im a dick. And then all this drama with Matt and Roxanne. They talked...that did a lot of fucking good now didnt it?! All Matt wants to do is make everything out to be his fault, i keep telling him it isnt, but he just wont listen. And then Roxanne just doesnt understand why things happen when she does stupid shit...its like Amanda in a way...just she sometimes thinks things through a bit more...sometimes...UGH! I love them both though, i really do. I dont think i could think about life without them as friends...even though i havent really known either of them for very long, i feel so close to them. I just wish they could get past this fucking...THING between them. Its so frustrating. God this sucks. I havent felt this way in almost a year. Having so much shit on my mind that I just wanna cry 24/7. Of course thats a real pussy thing to say, but who cares...no one reads this damn thing anyway. First my mom decides she wants to come back into my life. And of course my asshole dad constantly getting on my case all the damn time. Then theres the pressures of money and thinking of how im gonna pay for college...what college im gonna go to. I dont even know anymore. Now all this other shit with two of my best friends AND more frustrations from my own girlfriend of a year. I wish this thing would give me some kind of feed back for my problems. I guess that kind of defeats the purpose of a journal though, huh? I mean, in a real book one you wouldnt get any feed back. Eh, whatever...im done writing, till next time...         """
"3785178,male,17,Student,Virgo,""03,July,2004"",""       So today was pretty damn uneventful. I had to wake up early this morning to go down to my dads old shop in North Miami. The place is called Aamco, its kind of funny that even though my dad doesn't actually work there, he can go in and use the shop for whatever he wants...and the guy who owns the place still pays him $150 a week...FOR NO REASON! Well, there probably is a reason, since my dads a fucking gangster, he more than likely owes him money or some shit and he's paying it off slowly, lol. So im there till about 11:30am then my dad asks me to do him a favor. He hands me $10 and tells me to pick up my sister and her friend from the house and then drive down to Sheridan Street. Which is like a good 10 minute drive one way, and I was exhausted to begin with. The really shitty part is, that on the way back, I got fucking lost...and then it starts to down poor. Like cats and dogs down poor, it sucked. I ended up having to call my dad to figure out where I was. I hate the high-way sometimes, its not descriptive enough. Like one sign will say, 'North,' but the street you're already on is going North. And then there's no other sign saying that the road you are on now, is going to start going in a completely different direction then the one you were going in. ITS SO CONFUSING! Maybe im just dumb...or not...who knows. So anyway, I get home, take a nap, and go to work. And work is fine, no problems, lots of conversation, not too boring...but when we close Chris comes up to me and tells me my fucking drawer is $6.05 short. I don't understand how that happen, its never happened before. Well, good news is we made a tip cup that night and I made $3, so I gave him the three and he said he would cover the rest for me this time. God damn did that suck, lol.

I would think we would have to considering all of it that surrounds us. Is there a way to completely block it out and if so will it make me a happier person. You see, I am a fairly happy person. I enjoy laughing and being silly and letting the inner child in me come out to play every so often.      So last night I and a few friends were having a little get together. Ya know some jokes a few bottles of wine couple hands of cards. The usual. Well I had heard this news story on the radio earlier in the day that just made me think....wow....Weird. Crazy. So let me enlighten you guys on this rather odd and extremely disgusting news tidbit that fell into my lap while driving.         In some state that I'm unsure of last week there was a dentist who had his license taken away from him for injecting his 'happy juice' into the mouths of his un-suspecting patients, telling them it was a dental rinse, and then asking them to swallow it. Well, apparently a few of the poor women this happened to knew what it was they had just tasted and got together and sued him. Upon a search of the dentists office they found several syringes in his desk drawer full of said 'happy juice'. YUCK!      Ok so the point to that was... my boyfriend walked in the room where me and my friends were all hanging out after he had come out of the bathroom and wiped his wet hand on me. Triggering me to think 'ewwww he just wiped pee on me' which then triggered me to think of the news story I had heard earlier cause it has to do with bodily fluids. So I tell my friends the story, mainly to gross them out as it did me. Then this guy, we will call him John. ( not my friend) starts telling me what a negative person I am and how he doesn't even listen to things like that because he doesn't allow negative energy to consume him. Okay, I am thinking John is a complete fucking moron. I was just sharing a news story. Then he goes into how he has this forcefield around him that no negativity can withstand. To quote him ' It would be like a spitball hitting an airplane.' What the fuck, dude??? By this point everyone is confused now and they all we all just keep saying, Huh? Huh? What? I'm confused.

Although, I feel like who I am will probably reveal itself to you readers through these blogs more than I could ever explain. So on to why I have created this blog then shall we? I stubbled across this the other day while 'taking a little break' from work. You see I always read the Real World/Road Rules Blog spot. I just love both of those shows, it truely is an obbsesion.

I was born in Birmingham, Alabama where I grew up living a twisted version of a somewhat normal life until I was 16. At that age I got married ( yes I know 'married at 16, lives in Alabama' I am not that stereotype. Though I do meet all the qualifications!) and stayed married until I was 19 and living in Tampa, Florida. I left my husband and came home to Alabama. Then I met someone and left for Cleveland, Ohio, where I resided for three years and returned back to Alabama at the age of 21. For the past five years I have been living with my boyfriend in our house here in Alabama. I have had all types of jobs and many reasons for the choices I have made. Some not very good ones I will have to admit. However, I would not change a thing. I am mostly happy with the person I am today and where I am at.

Since I live close to work (about a 5 min drive) my friends made me go home and change into a saree. Luckily my mum was at home so she draped the saree for me. The weekend was pretty busy. I met up with a few of my old office friends on Sunday after nearly 2 years. It was a huge effort on Ash’s part to get all of us together, but she did it nevertheless. It was really nice catching up on what has been going on and most surprising was, after we spoke for sometime, we realized most of our colleagues in office are either married or have a baby!!!!! We all met up at Barista and sat there for about 2 hours just catching up on what we had missed. Jerry is now a manager doing Strategic Planning (playing Sin) :o), Dhanya and Ash are trainers, Bryan is a Quality Analyst, Anne is back in college and Sujit and Conrad are doing very well for themselves. Gayathri who apparently didn’t turn up on Sunday, is now in charge of training. Three years back, all of us just out of college, looking for some place to start our careers. We got to know each other better and sooner than we realized we were good friends. All of us were in one team fortunately J and we continued to work together. Being our first job, every one was very enthusiastic, especially Ash, she would come to work even on her days off; our manager had to literally drive her back home. It was these friends who like a dose of caffeine, kept me awake during night shifts (2:30 am – 11:30 am).They were one of the reasons I looked forward to going to work (and the salary also :0) We used to go sometimes to a resort on team outing’s and we used to have a ball. Getting back to work next morning was a problem, but that’s beside the point. Little by little, people started leaving; Sujit was the first one and then Anne, then Connie and Brian and then me. Ash, Gayathri, Dhanya and Jerry still work in the same place. As months and years went by, we lost touch; everyone was so busy doing their own thing but the evening out on Sunday was an ice-breaker. It was like re-living the good times we had, how this first job has molded our future, our personality and not forgetting the precious friends we made. There is nothing better than the pleasant memories you carry with you as you move ahead in life.          """

It’s not very nice when you finish your work at the beginning of that day and then you have about 3-4 hours left with nothing to do.

To celebrate the spirit of Independence we decided to dress in Indian Traditional clothes. I conveniently forgot about it and realized this just before I could leave from home this morning and it was too late to decide to wear a saree. The Saree is the Indian Traditional Dress worn by the women. It is usually 5-6 yards longs and is draped around the waist in a very beautiful and elegant way which I don’t think I will ever be able to master. It takes me hours to wear the saree and even after that it looks like I’ve just wrapped a bed sheet around myselfL. A Saree comes in different fabrics, Chiffon, Georgette, Silk and Cotton, to name a few. There is a particular type of saree with a lot of gold thread woven in the fabric, this is called ‘Zari’ and it is the most beautiful Indian Dress I have ever seen.

Why can't I have a sweet job that gives me the summer off and pays me for it.  Or shoot...why not the whole year!  What I wouldn't do for that job.  Anyhow, here are some highlights of the weekend: 1. Cory and 8ball on the walkie talkies.  I think their next occupation should be truck drivers.  They've aced the most important part of the job - CB radio kings.  2. Fixing Christi's car hood on the side of the 46 at 2am.  8ball mcguivered it with a license plate screw, strap, and duct tape.

Enough said on that subject.  I mean really...we all know I'm the wine queen!  4. Riding on a motorcycle with 8ball.  I was pretty much scared shitless and swore that I would never get on one of those death machines.  But 8ball finally wore me down.  I had a great time and am looking forward to riding with him again.  I just need the proper equipment.  My sister has pretty much stated that I will be murdered if I do not get proper footwear.  So I'm going out this weekend and getting some steel-toed boots that will save my little footsies from serious damage.  (And I'm definitely of the mindset that I don't really ever want to have to put them to the test!  So you better be safe with me Mr. 8ball!)  5. Motorcycle races at Laguna Seca (the whole reason for the trip).  8ball brought them up a couple of months ago and stated that he didn't want to miss THE races at Laguna Seca.  I was thinking that 2 days of watching motorcycle races was pretty much going to be the death of me.  But thankfully...they rocked!  I had a great time.  We sat in awesome seats, right on the track, in the Aprilia tent. Those guys ride SOOO fast!  It's pretty cool watching them on the turns and hauling ass down the straight-a-ways.  Very fun.

"3837126,female,34,indUnk,Aries,""20,July,2004"",""        Well, the other day the most extraordinary thing happened. I was doing a Reiki treatment on myself and was working near the second chakra when I saw a beautiful little ball of light in my uterine area. This was decidedly not normal for me. I am not usually a visionary. I feel stuff but do not usually see them but this time I did.  &nbsp;  It didn’t take me long to figure out this could be a pregnancy. I looked at the date of my last period on the notes I keep and discovered that, yes, I was late.  &nbsp;  So upon my next grocery shopping expedition, I bought an E.P.T. test kit without saying anything to anyone and last Sunday I took the first test. It was positive. Even given the evidence, it was hard to believe. I mean we had just 2 months ago decided that another baby wouldn’t be too bad. We decided to leave it up to God and if it happens, it happens. It just didn’t seem possible it would happen so fast after making that decision. So a few hours later, I took the other test. It was positive too.  &nbsp;  I told my daughter first, she is 13 and was home and my husband wasn’t. After we decided we couldn’t wait to tell him, we took off and drove to the workshop he was at to tell him the good news. He was very happy.  &nbsp;  Monday morning at 8 am I was on the phone trying to get an appointment with the doctor. My doctor called me personally and though he couldn’t fit me in till the next day, he did order the blood test which is required to verify the home tests. I went and had the unsurprising results by 5. &nbsp;  Today I went in to see the doctor and though we didn’t have to time for a formal prenatal check, he was able to address my concerns and take my history. He seemed as excited about the baby as I am. This doctor is a family practice doctor and is probably my favorite doctor of all time. But I wasn’t certain he would be willing to take care of this pregnancy because with my history, it is considered a high risk pregnancy but he took it in stride and also was very encouraging about my Reiki as well. That is some doctor.  &nbsp;  I have my first actual OB check on august 3rd where we plan to make certain there is only one baby and do the requisite tests and stuff.  &nbsp;  So where did the name Whosit come from? Well, on Monday when I was speaking to the children about the baby, I ran up against the awkward language of someone trying to talk about a baby we don’t have any idea if it is a boy or girl and we do not know anything else about. I didn’t want to simply choose a sex because my son is young enough to latch on to it as the truth and be disappointed if it turns out to be different. So I was extending my sentences with “him or her” and “he or she” and all that when my daughter caught on to the problem and dubbed the baby “Baby Whosit”. It seemed appropriate so that’s how we began to call the baby Whosit.  &nbsp;  I am going to blog this pregnancy so I can one day say to Whosit, “before you were born, you were blogged”. Also this will be a handy way of keeping records about my pregnancy and keeping my friends up to date on what’s happening with Whosit.  &nbsp;  Unless something happens in the interim, I will most likely be updating this when I have my next doctor’s appointment on august 3rd.  &nbsp;  Until then,  Lylah &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;             """
