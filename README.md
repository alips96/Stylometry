# Stylometry
Stylometry is the application of the study of linguistic style, usually to written language, and as the linguistic discipline, that evaluates an author's style through the application of statistical analysis to a body of their work.

In this project, we get a large corpus of different authors' text and train the data in a way that after analyzing, the program would be able to guess the author of a text based on his/her writing style.

This program is a windows form application written in C# and the input should be a CSV file containing the authors' texts.
